## Statistical Methods II

Welcome to Statistical Methods II. Goal is to become familiar with parametric and non-parametric statistical methods and inferential procedures. Topics include contingency table analysis, analysis of variance, experimental design,
topics from multiple regression, error rates, and power. We emphasize non-theoretical development of
statistical techniques and focus in interpretation of results. Statistical software will be utilized in the course.
Software: **SPSS**, **MINITAB** and **SAS** will be used as the computing packages of this course. Homework may be done
using these packages.
