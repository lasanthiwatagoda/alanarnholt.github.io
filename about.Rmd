I am an Assistant professor in the department of Mathematical sciences at Appalachian state University. I am from Sri Lanka originally, and after my undergraduate studies at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, I joined the Master program in the department of Mathematics at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale. 
I completed my PhD in Mathematics at the same University where my research focused on 
Statistical learning which is a branch of applied statistics that emerged in response to machine learning, emphasizing statistical models and assessment of uncertainty.
I often enjoy working with big data sets.
